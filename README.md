# Celebscan API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/infosupport/celebscan-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/infosupport/celebscan-api)

Cache + Image proxy for the celebscan application. This application is used by the 
[Celebscan](https://github.com/infosupport/celebscan) application as a wikipedia cache and image proxy.

## Prerequisites 
Make sure you have .NET core 1.1 installed with the SDK installed on your machine.
If you're running on Windows it comes with VS2017. You can also install the SDK on its own.

file `src/Celebscan.Service/appsettings.Production.json` with the following settings:
